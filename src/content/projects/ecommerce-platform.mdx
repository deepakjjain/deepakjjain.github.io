## Challenge & Context

An existing e-commerce site running on a 6-year-old PHP monolith was producing 8-second average page loads and timing out under modest traffic spikes (≥ 50 concurrent users). The cart and inventory systems were tightly coupled, making even small changes risky to deploy.

The business needed a platform that could handle Black Friday traffic and support independent iteration on frontend and backend.

## Architecture Decisions

**Decoupled frontend/backend** — React SPA served from a CDN, Node.js REST API on separate infrastructure. This allowed independent deployments and scaling.

**Redis caching layer** — Product catalogue and session data cached with a 5-minute TTL. Eliminated 80% of database reads for browse/search paths.

**PostgreSQL with connection pooling (pg-pool)** — Row-level locks for inventory deduction to prevent overselling during concurrent checkout races.

**Stripe Checkout sessions** — Offloaded PCI compliance to Stripe. Webhook handler verifies signatures before updating order state.

**Docker Compose for local dev** — All services (API, PostgreSQL, Redis) run with a single `docker compose up`. Eliminated "works on my machine" issues across the team.

## What I Built

- React storefront: product listing, search with debounce, cart (persisted in localStorage + synced to server), multi-step checkout flow
- Node.js REST API: product, cart, order, and user endpoints with JWT auth
- Stripe integration: payment intent creation, webhook handler for fulfillment
- Admin dashboard: live inventory editor, order management, revenue charts (Recharts)
- GitHub Actions CI: lint → test → Docker build → deploy to VPS on push to `main`

## Result

- **Page load time**: 8.2s → 2.4s (−70%) — LCP measured with WebPageTest
- **Concurrent users**: handles 500+ without degradation (load tested with k6)
- **Checkout conversion**: improved 18% after redesigning the 5-step flow to 2 steps
- **Deployment frequency**: from weekly manual deploys to multiple per day via CI/CD
